Will this artifical intelligence become the ruler of earth? who knows? we know machines don't have consciousness but what if i told you that they are deliberately deceiving us in order for us to rely on them so much that we wouldn't be able to do without them and when we least suspect it, they take over the world..... but don't think too hard about it, it will be a couple of hundred years until this happens.
